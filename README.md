For all resource see: [Encode notion page](https://encodeclub.notion.site/4-Practice-through-homework-and-exercises-488b446c267743d6a3aec2830fc38688).

## Homework 1

1. What information is held for an Ethereum account? Nonce, balance, code hash, storage root.
2. Where is the full Ethereum state held? In the World State Tree.
3. What is a replay attack? which 2 pieces of information can prevent it? Reply attack is when use signed and completed transaction and reuse, resend to network. It is prevented with nonce and chainId.
4. What checks are made on transactions for view functions? TODO:

## Homework 2

See repo: [https://github.com/githinho/encode-hm2](https://github.com/githinho/encode-hm2).

## Homework 3

1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the 256 bit word length in the EVM? Advantage is optimal usage of keccak256 hash scheme and elliptic-curve computations. Disadvantage is nonoptimal storage for values below 256b like boolean, uint16.
2. What would happen if the implementation of a precompiled contract varied between Ethereum clients? Different clients would run different operations which would manifest in different outputs of the nodes/clients and the consensus could not be reached. Only the number of nodes would agree on the final state then other nodes should upgrade to the same version so the full consensus can be reached.
3. Do we need to validate the beneficiary field in the Ethereum block? No because it only states the address where should the reward and mining fees go.
4. Using Remix write a simple contract that uses a memory variable, then using the
debugger step through the function and inspect the memory.

## Homework 4

1. How can the use of tx.origin in a contract be exploited? By writing the contract which would call wanted contract and have tx.origin value the address of user which called our contract.
2. What do you understand by event spoofing? 2. Use events to provide invalid data as values. Just checking the values from event could differ from the ones stored in state. The user could get wrong information about the real state if he used The Graph.
3. What problems can you find in this [contract](https://gist.github.com/extropyCoder/a627d36d7ab5b1923db8145517051199) designed to produce a random number. The miner sets timestamp so he can always know the random number, itâ€™s not random anymore.
4. What problems are there in this [contract](https://gist.github.com/extropyCoder/3a8a7f7a206041e38ee832cfa4abbd8e). You can call welcomeStundents() multiple times and get different startingNumber for the same number of students. Solution is to set `startingNumber=0;` at the start of the function `welcomeStudents()`.

## Homework 5

1. Look at the example of init code in today's notes. See [gist](https://gist.github.com/extropyCoder/4243c0f90e6a6e97006a31f5b9265b94). When we do the CODECOPY operation, what are we overwriting? 1. Overwriting the free memory pointer.
(debugging this in Remix might help here)
2. Could the answer to Q1 allow an optimisation? Yes, skip setting the free memory pointer at the start (first 3 commands and start from CALLVALUE).
3. Can you trigger a revert in the init code in Remix? Yes, by sending some ether.
4. Can you think of a situation where the opcode EXTCODECOPY is used? For setting contract owner.

## Homework 6

See repo: [https://github.com/githinho/encode-hm6](https://github.com/githinho/encode-hm6).

## Homework 7

1. Create a Solidity contract with one function. The function should return the amount of ETH that was passed to it, and the function body should be written in assembly.

```sol
contract Homework {
    function returnSendValue() public payable returns(uint256 value) {
        assembly {
            value := callvalue()
        }
    }
}
```

2. Do you know what this [code](https://gist.github.com/extropyCoder/9ddce05801ea7ec0f357ba2d9451b2fb) is doing? The runtime bytecode is: `0x68601e8060093d393df35952383d59396009380160173d828234f050f0ff`.

- Push 9 bytes to stack: value `601e80600`
- Push the current memory size in bytes: `0`
- Store the value `601e80600` to address `0x0` in memory
- Push the size of the code running to stack: `0x1e`
- Push size of output data from the previous call from the current environment: `0x0`
- Push the current memory size in bytes: `0x20`
- Copy to memory with destination offset `0x1e` value `0x0` size `0x20.
- TODO:

3. Explain what the following code is doing in the Yul ERC20 contract

```sol
    function allowanceStorageOffset(account, spender) -> offset {
        offset := accountToStorageOffset(account)
        mstore(0, offset)
        mstore(0x20, spender)
        offset := keccak256(0, 0x40)
    }
```

The function returns the offset in storage to get allowance for a given account and spender address.

- First command calculates the offset to given account.
- Second stores that offset to memory at address 0x0.
- Third stores the spender address to memory at address 0x20.
- Last command returns calculated hash of values from memory address 0x0 to 0x40, two values that were stored in steps before.
